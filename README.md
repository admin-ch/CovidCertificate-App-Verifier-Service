This project is released by the the [Federal Office of Information Technology, Systems and Telecommunication FOITT](https://www.bit.admin.ch/)
on behalf of the [Federal Office of Public Health FOPH](https://www.bag.admin.ch/).
The app design, UX and implementation was done by [Ubique](https://www.ubique.ch?app=github).

## Services
This service provides an API, which is consumed by the CovidCertificate-SDKs used by the COVID Certificate Apps of Switzerland. It publishes all the necessary data that is needed to verify a Digital Covid Certificate (DCC) in the client apps (offline). It also regularly syncs the DSCs with the EU-Gateway (`dgc-gateway`). The service itself does neither receive nor verify a DCC. 

### Webservice
Serves various data used for verifying the validaty of Digital Covid Certificates. Currently this includes:

* Public keys of Document Signer Certificates (DSCs)
* List of revoked UVCIs of Digital Covid Certificate (DCCs)
* National rules
* Value sets with test and vaccine mappings

## Usage
It is recommended to use the SDK (for iOS or Android) to verify the validity of Digital Covid Certificates. The SDK then interacts with this service. This service expects a bearer token to be passed in as `Authorization` header.

```
Authorization: Bearer <app-token>
```
